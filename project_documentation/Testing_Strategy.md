# Testing Strategy & Requirements

## 🎯 Purpose

Establish clear guidelines for maintaining application quality, ensuring stability, and catching issues early through structured testing strategies.

## ✅ Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library (for frontend), pytest (for backend/ML)
- **Coverage**: Target 80%+ code coverage.
- **Frequency**: Run unit tests on every pull request and before merges to the main branch.

### Integration Testing

- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest, Cypress
- **Coverage**: End-to-end API interactions, complex workflows (e.g., scoring runs, scenario management).
- Clearly defined integration tests to ensure frontend and backend communication is reliable.

### End-to-End Testing (E2E)

- **Tool**: Cypress
- **Frequency**: Automated run on every deployment to staging.
- **Coverage**: Critical user journeys (e.g., login flow, scenario creation, data updates, navigation flows).

### Regression Testing

- **Schedule**: Automated regression tests triggered upon merges into main.
- Ensure previously working features remain unaffected by new updates or deployments.

### Performance Testing

- **Tool**: Apache JMeter, Lighthouse
- **Metrics**: Page load time, server response times, API performance under load.
- **Frequency**: Prior to major releases or changes in infrastructure.

### Manual Testing

- Conducted for UX/UI validations, edge case workflows, and exploratory testing prior to major releases.
- Documented test scripts maintained clearly for consistency.

### Accessibility Testing

- **Standards**: WCAG AA
- **Tool**: Axe, Lighthouse
- **Frequency**: Regularly during frontend updates, and especially before major deployments.

## 🛠 CI/CD Integration

- All tests automatically executed in CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Clearly documented failure/success criteria.
- Automatic blocking of deployments on test failure.

## 📍 Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% test coverage across all critical business logic and APIs.
- Maintain clear, documented test coverage reports available in the repository.

## 📖 Documentation & Reporting

- Test results and reports clearly documented and easily accessible.
- Maintain structured test case documentation clearly tied to user stories and PRDs.

This structured approach ensures robust, reliable software with early detection and resolution of potential issues.
