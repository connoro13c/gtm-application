# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Data Loading, Mapping, Tagging, Transforming, and Merging Workflow

## ud83cudfaf Objective

Create a highly intuitive, interactive, and efficient workflow for loading, mapping, tagging, transforming, and merging diverse data sources. This system should empower RevOps teams to prepare data explicitly for advanced ML-driven account scoring and segmentation, without extensive technical overhead or dependency on external data teams.

## ud83dudccc Core Functionalities

### 1. Data Loading

**Sources Supported:** Salesforce, HubSpot, 6sense, Clay, Marketo, Gainsight, Totango, Vitaly, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Heap, Segment, CSV, Excel, Google Sheets, Custom APIs.

**Methods:**
- Manual file uploads (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Direct API integration (OAuth, API keys)
- Automated scheduled pulls (SFDC, HubSpot Reports)

**Features:**
- Real-time validation upon data load
- Immediate feedback highlighting data errors or mismatches

### 2. Data Mapping & Matching

**Unique Identifier:** Primarily Salesforce Account ID, with fallback options:
- Domain matching
- Account name fuzzy matching
- Manual overrides
- Custom unique key creation via concatenation and lightweight modeling

**User Experience:**
- Highly interactive drag-and-drop interface
- AI-driven auto-suggestions for field mappings based on data type and sample data

### 3. Data Tagging & Categorization

**Mandatory Unique ID Mapping:** Explicit step ensuring data alignment

**Predefined Categories:**
- Firmographic
- Sales Engagement
- Marketing Engagement
- Customer Health
- Product Usage
- Other

**Dynamic Suggestions:** Application-driven category suggestions during data load and mapping

### 4. Data Transformation

**Transformations Supported:**
- Date/time formatting
- Numeric transformations (aggregation, normalization)
- Text cleaning (normalization, fuzzy matching, deduplication)
- Field calculations (revenue per user, ARR/MRR calculations)
- Mass-change overrides within the app without impacting source data

**Real-Time Preview:** Immediate feedback showing transformation results

### 5. Data Combining & Merging

**Dataset Creation:** Explicit manual combination and merging of data sources into defined datasets

**Snapshots:** Backend capability for storing each dataset explicitly as snapshots upon updates

**Merge Conflict Resolution:**
- Visual conflict highlighting
- Interactive resolution workflow

**Scheduled Data Pulls:** Support for automated pulls with manual intervention points clearly marked for issue resolution

### 6. Data Validation & Quality Assurance

**Real-Time Validation:** Integrated into the data-loading workflow explicitly

**AI-Assisted Error Detection:** Immediate elevation and visual indication of critical data issues

## ud83dudd10 User Roles & Permissions

**Ops/Admins:** Full access to data loading, transformation, mapping, merging, configuration

**Sales & Customer Success Leaders:** Restricted access explicitly to their respective territories or segments with read/write/no access permissions clearly defined

## ud83dude80 Scalability & Performance

- Designed explicitly for handling 10,000u201320,000 accounts per scoring run
- Robust backend infrastructure leveraging Docker and containerization

## ud83dudcca Outputs & Integrations

- Export capability to CSV for ad-hoc analysis
- Structured database storage for all datasets and scoring runs
- Automated API calls to ML scoring models (microservices-based integration)

## ud83dudea8 Notifications & Workflow Automation

- Slack notifications explicitly for critical workflow events (data load errors, scoring completions, etc.)

## ud83dudee0 Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeORM/Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Recharts for initial analytics
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Microservices (ML), API-based integration

## ud83dudcdd User Onboarding & Documentation

- Embedded onboarding (guided tours, tooltips)
- Built-in documentation/help explicitly within the application

## ud83cudf1f Innovation & UX Principles

- Inspired by IBM Cognos TM1 Turbo Integrator (powerful mapping capability)
- Hyper-modern, clean, intuitive, enjoyable user interface explicitly tailored for RevOps teams

This PRD explicitly sets the groundwork for developing a robust, user-friendly, innovative data workflow solution tailored for advanced analytics and ML-driven insights.
