# Backend/Frontend Integration & State Management Documentation

This document outlines the state management approach and integration strategies between frontend and backend systems for the Advanced Account Scoring & Segmentation Application.

## State Management

### Frontend State Management

The application uses **Zustand** as the primary state management library.

#### Key State Stores

- **App State**: Global application state (authentication, user info, theme)
- **Account State**: Account data, filters, and sorting preferences
- **Scoring State**: Current scoring model, parameters, and results
- **Segmentation State**: Segmentation criteria and visualization settings
- **UI State**: Navigation state, sidebar visibility, modal visibility

#### State Management Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of data has one definitive source
2. **Minimal State**: Only store what's needed in global state
3. **Immutability**: State is never directly modified, only through actions
4. **Persistence**: Critical state persisted to localStorage where appropriate
5. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while waiting for API responses

### Backend State Management

- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization and temporary data
- **Job Queue**: For long-running processing tasks (scoring runs)

## Frontend-Backend Integration

### REST API Integration

- All client-server communication happens through RESTful API endpoints
- JWT token-based authentication
- Standard response formats and error handling
- See [API Documentation](API_Documentation.md) for details

### WebSocket Integration

WebSockets are used for real-time updates in specific features:

- **Scoring Progress**: Real-time updates on scoring calculation progress
- **Collaborative Features**: Notifications when multiple users edit the same scenario

### Data Flow Patterns

1. **Request/Response**: Standard REST pattern for CRUD operations
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, then confirm with server
3. **Polling**: For status updates on long-running operations
4. **WebSockets**: For real-time data and notifications
5. **Offline Support**: Critical functions work offline with sync on reconnect

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via Auth0 provider
2. JWT token stored securely in browser
3. Token attached to all API requests
4. Token refresh handled automatically
5. Session expiration notifications

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination for large data sets
- Virtualized lists for efficient rendering
- Debounced inputs for search and filtering
- Lazy loading of components and data
- Bundle splitting for efficient code loading

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Content Security Policy implementation
- API rate limiting
- Input sanitization and validation

## Error Handling Strategy

- Consistent error format across all API endpoints
- Graceful degradation for network failures
- Clear user feedback for all error states
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Logging and monitoring for error tracking
