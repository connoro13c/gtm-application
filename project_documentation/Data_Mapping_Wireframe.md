# Wireframe: Data Mapping & Matching Interface

## ud83cudfaf Objective

Design an intuitive and powerful user experience for mapping and matching data from multiple sources, ensuring all data aligns clearly and explicitly to a single unique account identifier.

## ud83dudccc Key Components

### Step 1: Data Source Selection
- Clearly displayed selection of previously uploaded data sources
- User explicitly chooses datasets to map and match

### Step 2: Interactive Mapping Interface
- Explicit drag-and-drop interface for mapping fields across datasets
- Clearly visible suggestions using AI/ML to auto-match similar fields
- Real-time feedback and immediate validation of mappings

### Step 3: Unique Identifier Matching
- Explicit confirmation step ensuring each dataset clearly aligns to the unique account identifier
- AI-driven suggestions for matching identifiers based on domain, account name, or custom criteria
- Manual overrides clearly available to address unmatched records

### Step 4: Data Preview & Validation
- Immediate visual preview of matched data clearly displayed
- Highlight mismatches, duplicates, or data type issues explicitly
- Interactive tools to resolve issues directly within the interface

### Step 5: Save & Snapshot
- Explicit naming and saving of mapping configurations as reusable templates
- Clearly structured snapshots of data at each mapping stage
- Version tracking explicitly defined

## ud83dudea8 Error Handling & Conflict Resolution
- Explicit identification and clear visualization of conflicts
- Interactive conflict resolution workflow explicitly guiding users step-by-step

## u2699ufe0f User Experience Principles
- Intuitive, wizard-driven navigation explicitly designed for Sales Ops and Rev Ops analysts
- Immediate feedback, validation, and real-time AI-driven assistance
- Visual clarity emphasizing ease of navigation and rapid problem resolution

**Next Steps:** Confirm this mapping wireframe and proceed to the "Data Tagging & Categorization" wireframe.
