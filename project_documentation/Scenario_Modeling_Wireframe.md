# Scenario Modeling Wireframe & UX/UI Specification

## üéØ Purpose

Empower Sales Ops teams to quickly and interactively create, adjust, and evaluate different scoring scenarios, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize account segmentation and sales prioritization.

## üìå Core Components & Layout

### Section 1: Scenario Configuration Interface

**Interactive sliders and inputs for adjusting scoring components clearly:**
- Firmographic Data Weight
- Engagement Metrics Weight
- Historical Sales Data Weight
- User Input/Overrides Weighting

**Button to select ML scoring model type explicitly:**
- Dropdown or toggle clearly labeled: "Select Scoring Model"
- Options (with pros and cons clearly listed):
  - Random Forest (default, balanced accuracy, explainable, robust)
  - Logistic Regression (fast, simple, easy interpretation)
  - Additional advanced models:
    - Gradient Boosting (high accuracy, longer compute time)
    - Neural Networks (excellent pattern recognition, less transparent)
    - Support Vector Machines (robust with smaller datasets, computationally intensive)
- Pros and Cons summary displayed clearly for each model when selected

**"Calculate Score" button to trigger scoring based on selected model type:**
- Real-time calculation indicator clearly visible

**Real-time visual feedback showing immediate impact of adjustments on propensity scores (post-calculation):**
- Scenario summary metrics (average score, number of high-value accounts)
- Impact visualization (graph/chart)

### Section 2: Scenario Comparison & Analysis

**Interactive side-by-side comparison (up to 3 scenarios clearly displayed):**
- Scenario names and key weightings clearly labeled
- Explicit visual indicators highlighting differences across scenarios (positive, negative, neutral)
- AI-generated summary explicitly detailing key differences and recommended actions

### Section 3: Scenario Persistence Management

**Simple, intuitive scenario saving and version management:**
- Scenario naming and description input fields
- Scenario status clearly labeled (Draft, Active, Archived)
- Version control and audit trails for all scenario adjustments

**Quick actions clearly marked:**
- Publish Scenario
- Duplicate Scenario
- Archive Scenario

### Section 4: Interactive Historical Scenario Analysis

**Clearly structured visualization of historical scenario changes and outcomes:**
- Historical trendlines showing scenario performance over time
- Predictive accuracy comparisons between scenarios
- Drill-down capabilities into specific accounts or segments impacted by scenario adjustments

### Section 5: AI-driven Scenario Recommendations

**AI-generated explicit recommendations clearly suggesting:**
- Optimal scenario configurations
- Adjustments for improving scenario effectiveness (e.g., "Increase weighting of tech-stack data for better predictions in software segment")

### Section 6: Quick Navigation & Related Workflows

**Seamless quick links clearly connecting to:**
- Dashboard
- Data Sources & Mapping Management
- Account Segmentation Analysis
- Predictive Insights & Reports

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interactivity & UX Considerations

- User-friendly controls for rapid scenario creation and adjustment
- Instant visual feedback and clear, actionable insights
- Robust scenario versioning and management for easy collaboration and decision-making
